# context-copy Specification

## Purpose
Provide right-click context menu operations (plain copy and quoted copy) on markdown content in ChangeViewer and SpecViewer.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Context menu on viewer markdown content
The system SHALL display a context menu when the operator right-clicks on the markdown content area in ChangeViewer or SpecViewer. The context menu SHALL use the project's existing ContextMenu component from `$lib/components/ui/context-menu/`. The context menu SHALL appear within the content area. The context menu position SHALL be clamped to the viewport.

#### Scenario: Right-click on ChangeViewer markdown content shows viewer text actions
- **WHEN** the operator right-clicks anywhere on the markdown content area in ChangeViewer
- **THEN** a context menu appears at the cursor position
- **AND** the menu contains `Copy`, `Quote Copy`, and `Search` items

#### Scenario: Context menu appears for ChangeViewer spec delta content
- **WHEN** the operator right-clicks on a spec delta's markdown content in ChangeViewer
- **THEN** a context menu appears with the same items
- **AND** the quoted copy uses the spec delta capability name as context

#### Scenario: Right-click on SpecViewer markdown content shows viewer text actions
- **WHEN** the operator right-clicks anywhere on the markdown content area in SpecViewer
- **THEN** a context menu appears at the cursor position
- **AND** the menu contains `Copy`, `Quote Copy`, and `Search` items

### Requirement: Search from viewer selection context menu
The system SHALL provide a `Search` item in the viewer markdown context menu. The item SHALL use the current `window.getSelection()` text as its source selection, but SHALL only be enabled when the trimmed selection is a valid search keyword. A valid search keyword SHALL be 2 to 80 characters long after trimming outer whitespace and SHALL NOT contain newline, carriage-return, or tab characters. When the selection is invalid, the `Search` item SHALL be disabled and cannot be clicked.

#### Scenario: Enable Search for a valid ChangeViewer selection
- **WHEN** the operator selects a single-line phrase in ChangeViewer whose trimmed length is between 2 and 80 characters and contains no tab characters
- **AND** right-clicks inside the markdown content area
- **THEN** the `Search` item is enabled

#### Scenario: Enable Search for a valid ChangeViewer spec delta selection
- **WHEN** the operator selects a single-line phrase inside ChangeViewer spec delta content whose trimmed length is between 2 and 80 characters and contains no tab characters
- **AND** right-clicks inside that markdown content area
- **THEN** the `Search` item is enabled

#### Scenario: Enable Search for a valid SpecViewer selection
- **WHEN** the operator selects a single-line phrase in SpecViewer whose trimmed length is between 2 and 80 characters and contains no tab characters
- **AND** right-clicks inside the markdown content area
- **THEN** the `Search` item is enabled

#### Scenario: Disable Search for multiline or tabbed selection
- **WHEN** the current viewer selection contains a newline, carriage return, or tab character
- **AND** the operator right-clicks inside the markdown content area
- **THEN** the `Search` item is disabled and cannot be clicked

#### Scenario: Disable Search for too-short or too-long selection
- **WHEN** the trimmed viewer selection is shorter than 2 characters or longer than 80 characters
- **AND** the operator right-clicks inside the markdown content area
- **THEN** the `Search` item is disabled and cannot be clicked

### Requirement: Plain text copy from context menu
The system SHALL provide a "Copy" item in the context menu. When selected, the system SHALL copy the currently selected text to the clipboard using `navigator.clipboard.writeText()`. If no text is selected, the item SHALL be disabled (greyed out, non-clickable). The selection scope SHALL be the current `window.getSelection()`, which may include text outside the viewer content area. After a successful copy, the system SHALL show a toast notification confirming the action.

#### Scenario: Copy selected text via context menu
- **WHEN** the operator has text selected in the window
- **AND** right-clicks on the markdown content and selects "Copy"
- **THEN** the selected text is copied to the clipboard
- **AND** a toast notification shows "Text copied"

#### Scenario: Copy item disabled when no text selected
- **WHEN** no text is selected in the window
- **AND** the operator right-clicks
- **THEN** the "Copy" menu item is disabled and cannot be clicked

### Requirement: Quoted copy from context menu
The system SHALL provide a "Quote Copy" item in the context menu. When selected with text selected, the system SHALL copy the selection to the clipboard in Markdown blockquote format with context information. The format SHALL be:
```
> [change-name] context-label
> selected text
```
Where `context-label` is: in ChangeViewer's file content tab the active file name, in ChangeViewer's spec deltas tab the spec delta capability name, and in SpecViewer the label `Specification`. Each line of the selected text SHALL be prefixed with `> `. If no text is selected, the item SHALL be disabled. The selection scope SHALL be the current `window.getSelection()`, which may include text outside the viewer content area. After a successful copy, the system SHALL show a toast notification confirming the action.

#### Scenario: Quote copy with file context in ChangeViewer
- **WHEN** the operator has text selected in a file content tab in ChangeViewer
- **AND** right-clicks and selects "Quote Copy"
- **THEN** the clipboard contains the selected text in blockquote format with the change name and file name
- **AND** each line of the selected text is prefixed with `> `

#### Scenario: Quote copy with spec delta context in ChangeViewer
- **WHEN** the operator has text selected in a spec delta in ChangeViewer
- **AND** right-clicks and selects "Quote Copy"
- **THEN** the clipboard contains the selected text in blockquote format with the change name and the spec delta capability name
- **AND** each line of the selected text is prefixed with `> `

#### Scenario: Quote copy with spec context in SpecViewer
- **WHEN** the operator has text selected in the Specification tab in SpecViewer
- **AND** right-clicks and selects "Quote Copy"
- **THEN** the clipboard contains the selected text in blockquote format with the spec name and "Specification"
- **AND** each line of the selected text is prefixed with `> `

#### Scenario: Quote copy item disabled when no text selected
- **WHEN** no text is selected in the window
- **AND** the operator right-clicks
- **THEN** the "Quote Copy" menu item is disabled and cannot be clicked

#### Scenario: Multiline selection in quote copy
- **WHEN** the operator has multiple lines of text selected
- **AND** right-clicks and selects "Quote Copy"
- **THEN** each line of the selection is prefixed with `> `
- **AND** the first line includes the `> [change-name] context-label` header
